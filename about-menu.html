                        <p>I first discovered programming in 2016 or 2017. I was enchanted with the idea that my passion for creating and building things could translate into a career. I began teaching myself through books and different websites like codecademy and freeCodeCamp.
                      In May of 2019 I decided to pursue organized education by enrolling in the Full Stack Web Development course of Lambda School. While this is a large undertaking as I also work full time,it is incredibly exciting to see my skills growing. When I am not coding, I enjoy reading fiction, as well as spending time with friends exploring the area in which I live.</p>

                          <p> I love learning new things, teaching others, and sealife! My main programming experience is in JavaScript, although I have academic experience in other languages, such as Java and Visual Basic. I am currently working with Atlas Technologies, Inc as a Software Tester. Working for Atlas has given me a flexible opportunity that has allowed me to get hands-on experience in designing, developing, maintaining, and integrating web applications with responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect user interfaces. I am also enrolled in Lambda School, under their Full Stack Web Development track, in order to fill gaps in my knowledge and stay on top of new and developing technologies!</p>
